## Overview

The three basic components for a functioning robotic system are perception, planning and controls. Based on the inputs from these 3 sub systems the robot's behavior is defined. In this project we have chosen the topic of controls and decided to design a software which acts as a module of a larger self-driving car software stack. The ackerman steering is the most widely used steering constraints in robots to large automobiles. To design a module which takes into account the steering constraints and designs a controller on top of it to achieve a goal pose of the vehicle queried by any other system of the robot like perception or navigation systems.

## Phase 0:
During Phase 0, we initiated the project with a high-level design, focusing on UML, and created an activity diagram that includes classes. This diagram serves as a valuable tool for comprehending the project's process flow. Comprehensive explanations of the Phase 0 process and its implementation are available in a video accessible through this google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D6kjTWbVGHKaCZbz6bTfUVqyngHtdGbq/view?usp=share_link)
