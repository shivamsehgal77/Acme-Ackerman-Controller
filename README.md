## Overview

The three basic components for a functioning robotic system are perception, planning and controls. Based on the inputs from these 3 sub systems the robot's behavior is defined. In this project we have chosen the topic of controls and decided to design a software which acts as a module of a larger self-driving car software stack. The ackerman steering is the most widely used steering constraints in robots to large automobiles. To design a module which takes into account the steering constraints and designs a controller on top of it to achieve a goal pose of the vehicle queried by any other system of the robot like perception or navigation systems.

## Phase 0:
In phase 0 we have started with high level design which is the UML and made activity diagram with classes which will be helpful in understanding the project process flow. The details regarding the phase 0 process and implementation are clearly explained through a video which can be accessed through this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tj4G0VvpHVoRTa6DeKy0NeDprOo1u-xy?usp=sharing)
